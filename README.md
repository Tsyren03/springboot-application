# My first SpringBoot project
This project is a web application built with Spring Boot, incorporating key technologies such as OAuth2 for secure user authentication, an H2 in-memory database for easy data management, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management and enhanced security. These technologies ensure that the application is secure and efficient, with minimal configuration required for database setup. <br>

Future plans for the project include deploying the application on AWS to take advantage of cloud infrastructure and scalability. I also plan to integrate CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring continuous delivery and seamless updates.
